# Sentiment Classifier Jupyter Notebooks
This directory contains several notebooks developed during my capstone project. In these notebooks I ran various, 
explorations, tests, and analysis which ultimately shaped my final ETL pipeline as well as the production predition web app.

#### Data_Wrangling_Exploration

In this notebook I prepared, cleaned, and ran exploratory data analysis on the audio files of the MELD dataset. I began
testing feature engineering ideas as well.

#### Model_selection

Here I experiment with some preprocessing techniques and assessed several ML models for initial performance.

#### DL_Prototype

In this notebook I prototyped a deep learning approach to the sentiment classification problem.

#### ML_Prototype

Here I prototyped a traditional machine learning approach to sentiment classification.

#### Scale_Prototype

In this notebook I look at a couple of ways of scaling up the selected ML prototype.
